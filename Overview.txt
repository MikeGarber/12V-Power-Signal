This is a scheme by which short slow msgs can be overlayed on a DC Power line 
to distributed devices.

It is roughly based on a scheme outlined at 
http://www.kranenborg.org/ee/picaxe/SerialPower/V3.0/PicaxeSerialPowerNetwork_V3.0.pdf.

This is a single master, multislave arranement.

The Master initiates any comm with the Msg (as bytes):
	<dst><src><func>[<data1><data2>]<crc><terminator>
		<dst><src> = ASCII; suggest startig with (lower case) 'a'; master could be '~'
		<func> = Function.  Some universal functions are:
				'?' - ACK if you're there (timeout, I guess, if you're not)
				'1'	 - On
				'0' - Off
		[<data1><data2>] = optional data as dictated by the <func>. 
		<crc> = binary summations of all preceding ASCII chars
		<terminator> = 0xff (hex)
		
After sending the Msg, the output line must be tri-stated (x uSec Delay?) to allow the 
slave to transmit.  A timeout allows to recognize the slave as being offline.

The Slave must Reply with (as bytes):
	<src><dst><returnStat>[<data1><data2>]<crc><terminator>
		<dst><src> - ASCII; suggest starting with (lower case) 'a'; master could be '~'
		<returnStat> - Some universal functions are:
				'!' - ACK.  Function executed
				'x'	 -NAK.  (data info probably follows)
							"NoFunct"
		[<data1><data2>] = optional data as dictated by the <func>. 
		<crc> = binary summations of all preceding ASCII chars
		<terminator> = 0xff (hex)
